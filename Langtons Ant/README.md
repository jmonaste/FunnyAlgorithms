# Langton's Ant

## Algorithm Description

Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine invented by **Chris Langton** in 1986. It's a simple cellular automaton that, despite its simplicity, exhibits complex emergent behavior.

### Movement Rules:

1. **White Square**:
   - **Turn Right** 90 degrees.
   - **Flip the color** of the square to **black**.
   - **Move forward** one unit.

2. **Black Square**:
   - **Turn Left** 90 degrees.
   - **Flip the color** of the square to **white**.
   - **Move forward** one unit.

Despite the simplicity of these rules, after a large number of steps, the ant starts building a repetitive pattern known as a "highway".

## Origin

The algorithm was first proposed by **Chris Langton**, an American computer scientist, as part of his studies on cellular automata and complex systems. Langton's Ant is a classic example of how simple local rules can lead to complex global behavior.

## Uses and Applications

- **Education**: An excellent tool for teaching concepts of cellular automata, dynamic systems, and emergent complexity.
- **Visualization**: Helps visualize how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules.
- **Research**: Used in studies on chaos theory, fractals, and complex systems.

## Available Implementations

Currently, the implementation is available in **Python**. In the future, we plan to add implementations in other programming languages to increase accessibility and allow more people to experiment with this fascinating algorithm.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- *(Optional)* A terminal that supports Unicode characters for better visualization.

### Execution

1. **Clone the repository or download the `langtons_ant.py` file.**

2. **Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.**

3. **Run the script with the following command:**

   ```bash
   python langtons_ant.py
